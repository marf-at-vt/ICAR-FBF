# ICAR-FBF
This repository contains R scripts that reproduce the analysis of crime rates in Columbus, OH presented in the paper "Objective Bayesian Model Selection for Spatial Hierarchical Models with Intrinsic Conditional Autoregressive Priors", by Porter, Franck, and Ferreira

To reproduce the analysis, download the files columbus.crime_study.R and olm.icar.sar_functions.R to the same folder. After that, run the R script contained in columbus.crime_study.R. Line 51 of the latter file will source the functions contained in the file olm.icar.sar_functions.R.
